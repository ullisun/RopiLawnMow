# INA Sensor

To analize the voltage and the current of the motors I use the INA 3221. You will find the first picture of the wiring in the IMG folder

If you start the The Ropi_INA3221.py Script, you can see the result on the screen, and store the data for later anlysis. Also a file Interface to the PiMowBitIT-SW is implemented. The Ropi_INA3221.py is based on this example:

Please copy the SDL_Pi_INA3221.py in the same direction or refer to the valid path

The Python file runs on the Raspberry Pi as a service in /etc/systemd/system/ 
The advantage: The service starts the Python Script every time agian if the connection breaks down

I coded the Android App in Android Studio. I am not not an expert in Android Studio, so I exported the Project as
zip file and also as apk. So far I tested it you can copy the apk file in your Android Download directory.
A double click will install the App. In the zip file all sources are included if you want to adapt it to your needs.

When I started with coding, my plan was to have a BLE Communication between Pi and mobile Phone. This was extremly 
difficult for me. So I changed it to the calssic Bluettooth stack. But I forgot to change the name of the App.
So if you will test it, use classic BT and pair your mobile before with your Pi.
-Good Luck-
